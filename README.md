# Psitegrad's Status Effect Rebalance for Made in Abyss BSFD

A mod that aims to rebalance status effect in this game.  
The abyss should be an arduous environment for inexperienced or insufficiently prepared delvers.

Note that this is my personal preference, too often I find them easy to ignore as the penalty is relatively mild.  
Now there is an incentive to prepare for these lest the resources used to recover snowballs later.  
Of course you could just not get hit ðŸ˜‰


### Description

+ Doubled blue poison hunger penalty.  
[The very hunger for discovery that drived you into further depths, is now the one eating at you.]

+ Altered red poison effect, no longer an infinite Dot but hits hard enough that it will impair resources if not treated before the body purges it.  
[With your own vitality abandoning you, will your persist with grit or wisdom ?]

+ Slightly increased effects of red and blue poisons on enemy.  
[In time you will master the weapon used against you.]

+ Merged Heatnixx' Curse Balancing Mod, as it would have created conflicts.
  
+ Reduced curse effect time in layers that you've mastered.  
[Those who braved the Abyss long enough to adorn new whistles find their very body twisted by it, yet amidst hardships blessings overflow.]

+ Increased curse effect time in layers lower than you should be in.  
[The search parties gave up long ago, yet your dead companions whispers will follow long after.]

+ Gradual increase in curse effects penalties the deeper you go instead of fixed values shared across some layers (keep in mind each layer has a cap). The curve is gentler until Layer 4.  
[The ceilings of the past will be the floors of the future.]
